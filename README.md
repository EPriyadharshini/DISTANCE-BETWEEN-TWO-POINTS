# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: start the program
### Step 2:get input from the user  
### Step 3: substite the values in the distance formula
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4:point the document ofdistance between two points 
### Step 5: end the program
### PROGRAM:
```
#Program to circulate N values.
#Developed by: E.Priyadharshini
#RegisterNumber: 23012593
def circulate ():
b=a [n: ] +a [:n]
print ("After circulating the values are:",b)
a=eval (input ()]
n=int (input ())

```
  
##  OUTPUT:

### RESULT:
Thus The Distance Between Two Points are Sucessfully Executed
